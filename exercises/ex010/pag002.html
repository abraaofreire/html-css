    <h1>The 3 life-changing ideas in James Clear's Atomic Habits</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1% Better Every Day</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Compounding effect</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"These small improvements or declines compound and suddenly you find a very big gap between the people who make slightly better decisions on a daily basis and those who don't."</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Identity-Habit Harmony</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Who are you?</li>
            <li>"Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are - either consciously or non-consciously."</li>
            <li>"Whatever your identify is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it."</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Democracy of the Self</li>
        <ul>
            <li>"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your news identify."</li>
            <li>The second mistake</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus not on never failing, but on never letting failure become a habit of its own.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
